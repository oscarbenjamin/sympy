    This class is used internally in the by dsolve and related

    efficiently.

    Examples
    ========

    This class is used internally by dsolve. To instantiate an instance
    directly first define an ODE problem:

    >>> from sympy import Eq, Function, Symbol
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> f = Function('f')
    >>> eq = f(x).diff(x, 2)

    Now you can create a SingleODEProblem instance and query its properties:

    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.single import SingleODEProblem
    >>> problem = SingleODEProblem(f(x).diff(x), f(x), x)
    >>> problem.eq
    Derivative(f(x), x)
    >>> problem.func
    f(x)
    >>> problem.sym
    x

class SingleODESolver:
    """
    Base class for Single ODE solvers.

    Subclasses should implement the _matches and _get_general_solution
    methods. This class is not intended to be instantiated directly but its
    subclasses are as part of dsolve.

    Examples
    ========

    You can use a subclass of SingleODEProblem to solve a particular type of
    ODE. We first define a particular ODE problem:

    >>> from sympy import Eq, Function, Symbol
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> f = Function('f')
    >>> eq = f(x).diff(x, 2)

    Now we solve this problem using the NthAlgebraic solver which is a
    subclass of SingleODESolver:

    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.single import NthAlgebraic, SingleODEProblem
    >>> problem = SingleODEProblem(eq, f(x), x)
    >>> solver = NthAlgebraic(problem)
    >>> solver.get_general_solution()
    [Eq(f(x), _C*x + _C)]

    The normal way to solve an ODE is to use dsolve (which would use
    NthAlgebraic and other solvers internally). When using dsolve a number of
    other things are done such as evaluating integrals, simplifying the
    solution and renumbering the constants:

    >>> from sympy import dsolve
    >>> dsolve(eq, hint='nth_algebraic')
    Eq(f(x), C1 + C2*x)

    # hint.

class NthAlgebraic(SingleODESolver):
    r"""
    Solves an `n`\th order ordinary differential equation using algebra and
    integrals.

    There is no general form for the kind of equation that this can solve. The
    the equation is solved algebraically treating differentiation as an
    invertible algebraic function.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Function, dsolve, Eq
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> f = Function('f')
    >>> eq = Eq(f(x) * (f(x).diff(x)**2 - 1), 0)
    >>> dsolve(eq, f(x), hint='nth_algebraic')
    [Eq(f(x), 0), Eq(f(x), C1 - x), Eq(f(x), C1 + x)]

    Note that this solver can return algebraic solutions that do not have any
    integration constants (f(x) = 0 in the above example).

        Matches any differential equation that nth_algebraic can solve. Uses
        `sympy.solve` but teaches it how to integrate derivatives.

        solution (apart from evaluating the integrals).
